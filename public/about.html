        <h2>About this application</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/personality-insights/applied.shtml#otherRisk">Studies</a><span> show that personality influences an individual's risk taking behavior </span>in financial decisions. This demo uses <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/personality-insights.html">IBM Watson's Personality Insights</a><span> to determine an individual's personality from tweets and any other </span>available content the individual has authored. The inferred personality 
          is then used to determine the individual's risk propensity and assist 
          the advisor in the selection of fund recommendations. For example, in 
          this demo if we select client 'Cari', her personality shows that she 
          is high on openness change and low on cautiousness and conservation.  
          Her risk propensity is high and the advisor is presented high risk 
          funds for consideration. On the other side, if we choose client 
          'Lillian', she is high on cautiousness and conservation and low on 
          openness to change so low risk funds are recommended.  
        </p>
        <p> <span>Once a risk assessment based on personality is available,  </span><a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tradeoff-analytics.html">IBM Watson's Tradeoff Analytics</a><span> can be used to balance multiple financial objectives along with </span>personality match to help the advisor determine the best funds for the
          individual. 
        </p>
        <p> </p>Further, the demo shows how knowledge about an individual's personality
        can be used to match him or her to an agent who is most likely to close 
        the business and drive value out of the relationship. These insights can 
        also be leveraged to provide recommendations to the advisor in developing 
        the optimal engagement strategy. 
        <p> </p>This is a working demo that showcases how one might leverage the Personality
        Insights and Tradeoff Analytics cognitive services. This is not meant to be 
        a complete product or people recommendation engine. In a real scenario, 
        personality attributes will be used along with other relevant features to 
        learn an appropriate prediction model.
